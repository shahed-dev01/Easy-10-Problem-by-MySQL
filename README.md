# SQL Practice Project – Employee Database Analysis

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries designed to practice and demonstrate fundamental SQL operations such as `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `AVG`, `FLOOR`, and `ORDER BY`.

These queries are written using a fictional database named `employee_demographics` and `employee_salary` to analyze employee data such as age, salary, gender distribution, and filtering based on name patterns.
